        - two way binding       - One way binding       - two way binding
        
    6. Components: component file name start with Capital letter
        - Class Based Components/ stateful component
        - Functional Based Components/ stateless component

    7. Conditional Rendering

    8. State: Used to store data inside a components and it can be shared with other components as well
        - syntax: const [state-name,function-name to update state] = useState(initial-value)
        - to update state: function-name(value_to_be_updated) - it will update state value

    9. Data shairing from parent to child(only one way binding is possible in react)
        - Using Props

    10. React Hooks
        - useState(): to generate state in Functional component
        - useEffect(): allows to perform side effects in your components.
        - useParams(): return an object of key/value pairs of the dynamic params from the current URL
        - createStore(): to create store in redux
        - useDispatch() : dispatch actions from an component in react-redux
        - useSelector(): to select update state from store in react-redux
        - useNavigate(): to redirect from one page to another
        - useContext(): share state between deeply nested components
        
    11. To display an array: map array method
    12. react-router-dom library: To set up route for components
        - route: setup path for each componet
        - routes: to hold more route
        - BrowserRouter: to routes all components
        - Link: to navigate from one webpage to another 
    13. REDUX: State Management
        - store: to hold all state, where all components can access state
            - create store.js file in src folder
            - createStore hook - to create store
            - Provide the store to app: using <Provider> in index.js file
        - action: to define logic needed by component to update state
            - create action folder in src
                - inside action folder, create action js file
                - useDispatch hook : dispatch actions from an component
        - create constants folder in src
                - inside constants folder, create constants js file to hold constants
        - reducer: to update state and adding the update state in store
            - create reducers folder in src
                - inside reducers folder, create reducer js file
    14. createContext: create a context that components can provide or read
